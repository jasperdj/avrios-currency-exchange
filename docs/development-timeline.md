# Development timeline
**Why this document?** The goal of this document is to take you(the reviewer) with me along my journey towards completing this project to give insight on _how I work_. 

**How will this document achieve that goal?** By sharing insights, problems, considered options and solutions that occured with every Feature/Task (and its commits) in chronological order.

**How are features/tasks specified?**
For this project Github projects are used to organize epics/feature/tasks, because of Github limitations I use the following title formatting.

    ID [Epic - feature] Tasknr. task (R:requirement|S:stretch goal)
